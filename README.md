# Stem-based method to correct publication bias
This repository contains the `R` code to implement the [stem-based method](https://economics.mit.edu/files/12424) to correct publication bias in meta-analyses.

## Introduction
Stem-based method provides a meta-analysis estimate that is robust under various assumptions of publication selection processes and underlying distribution of true effects. The method is non-parametric and fully data-dependent, and the resulting estimates are generally more conservative than other commonly used methods. The method offers a formal criterion to choose the optimal number of most precise studies to compute the meta-analysis estimate.

This repository contains the following:
* code and data
  * stem
  * sample_data
* figures

## Description
The major advantage of using stem-based method over other methods is its robustness under various publication selection processes.
